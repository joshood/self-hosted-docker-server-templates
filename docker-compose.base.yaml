#The Docker Compose file defines how different services provided by containerized docker servers relate to one-another,
#how each should be configured, and in what order they should be started.  For more information about this file's
#function and syntax, refer to https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/

#This file requires you have already downloaded
#Docker https://www.docker.com/community-edition
#and
#Docker Compose https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
#Note: Docker compose is already bundled with Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac.  For Linux systems, please do
#not use the docker/docker-compose packages provided by your distro.  They are often extremely out-of-date and will not
#be compatible with most applications or this file.  Follow the installation instructions provided on the above sites.
#Also note: Docker for Windows depends on Microsoft Hyper-V, which is only available in Windows Professional and
#Enterprise versions and not available in Home versions.  If you wish to setup a Docker server, but only have Windows
#Home editions, I recommend you either repurpose an old, 64-bit capable PC and install Linux on it, or buy a
#Raspberry Pi and setup Docker on it.  This file assumes you are on an x86_64 architecture.  It would need to be
#rewritten to build the services from scratch (using the container's Dockerfile i.e. a recipe of how to build the
#container image) on the Raspberry Pi's ARMv7 processor architecture where/*IF* a pre-built ARM build is not available
#for a particular service.  You could also run Docker on a Linux Virtual Machine in Oracle VirtualBox, however, this
#negates the advantage of using lightweight, OS-level virtualization that doesn't require reserving memory for the VM
#and emulating hardware and also adds complexity for getting ports forwarded from your router, to your machine, to
#your virtual machine, to your service.  You could try running Docker for Linux on Windows using the Windows
#Subsystem for Linux https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 regardless of your Windows version,
#but I have no idea if that will work.

#The version section is mandatory.  It tells docker-compose which syntax version to use
version: '3.5'

#The services section is where you define which services your application will use.  Some applications are packaged
#as a single container that contains everything necessary to run your application, others are more modular requiring
#a separate database server from the application or web server, for example.  You can find available containers on
#https://store.docker.com.  Most (but not all) are 100% free.  Some are 'official' meaning they are published by the
#organization or team who wrote the code for the application, others are unofficial, community builds maintained by
#other users/developers.  Quality of unofficial containers cannot always be guaranteed

services:
#Free Dynamic DNS services provided by duckDNS.  https://www.duckdns.org/
#You must register with DuckDNS and set up a subdomain before filling out this section.
#This service provides you with a domain name which always points to your home server, even if your home
#ip address changes.  Your domain will be a subdomain of duckdns.org.  See https://www.duckdns.org/faqs.jsp for more
#info, inluding how to use duckDNS with a custom domain name (purchased separately)

    #Container metadata can be put in labels.  This is sometimes used to communicate information to other containers
    #or services e.g. to docker compose about what other services depend on this service, or to traefik reverse
    #proxy about how or if to proxy requests to this service

#A reverse proxy takes all requests it receives and, based on predfined rules, forwards the request to the appropriate
#destination.  Since we may be hosting many servers with different names, but all competing for HTTP ports 80 and 8080
#and HTTPS port 443, we put a reverse proxy in front of them to handle the requests on their behalf.  NGinX is a
#popular reverse proxy, but we will use Traefik https://traefik.io/ because it is easier to use, native to Docker,
#can be configured automatically, and will respond to changes in the environment as services are added or
#removed instead of hanging.  Traefik supports LetsEncrypt https://letsencrypt.org out-of-the-box and can
#automatically obtain and manage free, secure certificats for securing HTTPS connections

    #you use if you're building your own image from an existing one as a base.  Any data you need to persist
    #should be stored in a Docker volume.  Docker volums can either be named storage locations that can be defined
    #here in the compose file, or bind mounts to directories on the host machine both of which you can use
